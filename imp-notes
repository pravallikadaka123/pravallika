the control centre is dependant on schema registry bcz 
technically the control centre is listening for events on schema registry to visualize the data directly on kafka,which is managed by zookeeper
docker compose up to create docker images
docker images:
Zookeeper:
Role: Zookeeper serves as a coordination service for distributed systems. In the context of Apache Kafka, Zookeeper is responsible for managing the configuration information, providing distributed synchronization, and maintaining the state of Kafka brokers.
Real-world Example: Think of Zookeeper as the orchestrator that ensures all the components in your Kafka cluster are in sync and coordinated. For instance, Zookeeper helps Kafka brokers elect a leader, maintain metadata about topics and partitions, and handle failover scenarios.

Kafka Broker:
Role: Kafka brokers form the core infrastructure of the Kafka cluster. They store and manage the data streams, handle data ingestion from producers, and distribute data to consumers.
Real-world Example: Imagine you're building a real-time analytics platform for monitoring website traffic. Each Kafka broker represents a server that stores incoming data such as page views, clicks, and events. These brokers ensure that data is reliably stored, replicated, and distributed across the cluster for real-time processing and analysis.

Schema Registry:
Role: Schema Registry manages schemas for the data stored in Kafka topics. It ensures data compatibility and consistency by enforcing schema validation for producers and consumers.
Real-world Example: Suppose you're building a system for tracking user activity across different devices (web browsers, mobile apps, IoT devices). Schema Registry ensures that data produced by each device type adheres to a predefined schema, enabling downstream consumers to interpret and process the data correctly.
Having a predefined schema allows producers (devices or applications that generate data) and consumers (applications that process or analyze data) to agree on the structure and format of the data being exchanged. This ensures compatibility and interoperability between different components of the system.

For example, if a mobile app and a web application both produce data to the same Kafka topic, they must adhere to the same predefined schema for their messages. This ensures that downstream consumers can interpret and process the data correctly, regardless of its source.

Schema Registry helps enforce these predefined schemas by validating data produced by producers against the schema definition before allowing it to be published to Kafka. It also provides a centralized repository for storing and retrieving schemas, making it easy to manage schema evolution and versioning as the data model evolves over time.

Control Center:
Role: Control Center provides monitoring and management capabilities for Kafka clusters. It offers insights into cluster health, performance metrics, and operational tasks.
Real-world Example: In a real-time financial trading platform, Control Center helps monitor the throughput of trade messages, detect anomalies in data flow, and manage resources to ensure optimal performance. It also provides alerts and notifications for critical events such as broker failures or data processing delays.
In summary, each component in your Docker Compose configuration plays a crucial role in building a scalable, fault-tolerant, and real-time data streaming platform using Apache Kafka. Together, these components enable you to ingest, process, and analyze large volumes of streaming data in various real-world applications, ranging from IoT telemetry to financial transactions to social media analytics.

Overall, this Docker Compose configuration sets up a robust environment for building and operating a real-time data processing pipeline using Apache Kafka and related components.
It ensures that the components are properly configured, connected, and monitored within a containerized environment, making it easier to develop, deploy, and scale streaming applications.
